  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

  <h3>Does studying Punjabi help with ATAR?</h3>
  <p>
    Punjabi is studied as a full-year SACE subject in most cases (20 credits). Like any other Stage 2 subject, a student’s results in Stage 2
    can contribute to their overall tertiary admissions calculation and university selection processes, depending on their subject pattern and course requirements.
  </p>
  <p class="small-note">
    <em>
      ATAR rules and scaling are determined externally and can vary. We recommend students confirm subject choices with their school’s SACE/Pathways coordinator.
      Note also that completing the SACE has specific achievement requirements (e.g., Stage 1 compulsory requirements at C or better, and Stage 2 requirements at C– or better).
    </em>
  </p>

  <h3>Do universities give extra points for studying a language?</h3>
  <p>
    Some universities apply “adjustment factors” (also known as bonus points) that can increase a student’s <strong>selection rank</strong> for certain courses.
    These schemes vary between universities and courses, and they do not usually change the ATAR itself.
  </p>
  <p class="small-note">
    <em>
      Eligibility and the amount of adjustment (if any) depend on the institution and course. Students should check the admissions information for their preferred university/course.
    </em>
  </p>

  <h3>Who is eligible to enrol in SACE Punjabi?</h3>
  <p>
    SACE Punjabi is suitable for students completing SACE who wish to include Punjabi as part of their senior secondary learning plan.
    Students may be background speakers, heritage learners, or learners with prior Punjabi study.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stage 1 (2026):</strong> students typically in Year 11 (or as per their school learning plan)</li>
    <li><strong>Stage 2 (planned 2027):</strong> students typically in Year 12 (or as per their school learning plan)</li>
    <li><strong>Placement:</strong> may include a brief language proficiency check to confirm the most suitable pathway</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What level of Punjabi is required for SACE Punjabi?</h3>
  <p>
    Senior secondary Punjabi requires students to work with language at a more formal and academic level.
    Students should have (or be ready to develop) a strong foundation in Punjabi grammar and vocabulary, and be able to apply senior secondary study skills such as:
    <strong>text analysis</strong>, <strong>text production</strong> (structured writing), <strong>research</strong>, and <strong>prepared oral communication</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>What will students learn and be assessed on?</h3>
  <p>
    Students develop reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills alongside cultural learning connected to language use.
    Assessment typically includes a mix of oral and written tasks aligned with SACE expectations.
  </p>

  <h3>How much study time is expected outside class?</h3>
  <p>
    Like any senior secondary subject, students should expect regular home study (reading, writing drafts, vocabulary, and speaking practice).
    The amount varies depending on the student’s confidence level and goals.
  </p>

  <h3>Fees</h3>
  <p>
    Soan Chiri School of Language & Culture expects a small monetary contribution from families for each enrolled student.
    Fees are set by the school and are payable <strong>in full at the beginning of the year</strong>.
    Details of the current fee amount and payment instructions are provided at the time of enrolment.
  </p>

  <h3>Can students enrol mid-year?</h3>
  <p>
    Mid-year enrolment may be possible depending on places available and the student’s readiness to meet course requirements.
    Please contact us to discuss the most suitable option.
  </p>

  <h3>What if a student already speaks Punjabi at home?</h3>
  <p>
    Home speaking is a strong foundation. Senior Punjabi study focuses on formal skills such as grammar accuracy, reading and interpreting texts,
    structured writing, and confident oral communication in more academic contexts.
