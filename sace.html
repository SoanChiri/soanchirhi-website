    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section id="faq" class="info-card">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

      <h3>Does studying Punjabi help with ATAR?</h3>
      <p>
        Punjabi is studied as a full-year SACE subject in most cases (20 credits). Like any other Stage 2 subject, results may contribute to tertiary selection depending on subject patterns and course requirements.
      </p>

      <h3>Do universities give extra points for studying a language?</h3>
      <p>
        Some universities apply adjustment factors (bonus points). These vary by course and institution and do not usually change the ATAR itself.
      </p>

      <h3>Who is eligible to enrol?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stage 1 (2026):</strong> typically Year 11</li>
        <li><strong>Stage 2 (2027):</strong> typically Year 12</li>
        <li><strong>Placement:</strong> may include a brief language check</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Can students enrol mid-year?</h3>
      <p>No mid-year intake is offered by Soan Chiri School of Language & Culture.</p>
